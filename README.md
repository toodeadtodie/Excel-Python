Collecting data from different excel sheet to new one using python

Hello Guys, This is my first writeup on github and honeslty i am using github for the first time so i hope support from community.

So, i had given this task in my Office to make a program which can automatically capture data from multiple excel files and put it into one excel file.
earlier people used to mannualy open excel file and put the data to other excel file with hands which was prone to many typo errors and very hectic job.

The excel file was Vessel's Noon reoprt which a ship sends everyday and it contains details like date,speed,fuel consumption and operations etc. So i had beginners level python experience and by watching few youtube videos and applying my on logic beacuse i build this program which captured dat from all noon reports and put it into one excel file without typo error which made us easily analyise vessle's voyage performance.

Below is the code in text file attached, please feel free to ask if you any questions!
